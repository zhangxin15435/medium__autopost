Pure-JS cleanroom\nimplementation from official specifications, related documents, and test files.\nEmphasis on parsing and writing robustness, cross-format feature compatibility\nwith a unified JS representation, and maximal browser compatibility.\n\n\n## Test Files\n\nTest files should be placed in the `test_files` directory, in the appropriate\nsubdirectory for the filetype.  For example, DOCX files should be placed in\n`test_files\\docx\\wordjs` and RTF files should be in `test_files\\rtf\\wordjs`.\n\nEvery test file should be accompanied by a plain text `.txt` representation\nwhose filename is the original filename appended with `.txt`.  For example, the\nDOCX file `test_files\\docx\\wordjs\\foo.docx` pairs with the plain text file `test_files\\docx\\wordjs\\foo.docx.txt`\n\n**Generating Baselines using Word for Windows**\n\n0. Ensure you have PowerShell version 7.0 or greater\n1. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` OR `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in Powershell (PS) Admin 7.0\n2. Have the PS script in the root of the repo\n3. Run `.\\generate_txt.ps1 .\\test_files\\EXT_TYPE\\FOLDER` (ex. `.\\generate_txt.ps1 .\\test_files\\docx\\apachepoi`)\n\nOn first run, if a test file does not have an accompanying `.txt` file, the\nscript will open Word and save the file as plaintext.  Word will rapidly open\nand close during this process.\n\nThe script will not attempt to open Word or try to generate `.txt` files if they\nalready exist.  After a clean run, Word should not open on future runs.\n\nThe script will halt for documents that are broken in certain ways.  Word will\ndisplay a prompt, stalling the automated process.  Those documents can be\nskipped by creating a `.skip` file as described below.\n\n\n**Skipping Files**\n\nThe script will look for files with the `.skip` extension and skip processing\nthe base file.  For example, if `test_files\\docx\\wordjs\\Hello.docx.skip` exists,\nthe script will not attempt to process `test_files\\docx\\wordjs\\Hello.docx`\n\nWhen the UI blocks (for example, on a VBA error with `ThisDocument`), the\ncorresponding `.skip` file should be created manually.  The script merely tests\nif the file exists, so the content is immaterial and a single letter suffices.\n\n**Generating `.skip` files**\n\nThe script will attempt to open password-protected documents using the password\n\"WordJS\".  The script will not halt but it will not generate a text file.  With\na few adjustments, the script can generate `.skip` files for those cases\n\n1. Uncomment [L27-29](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-word/blob/master/generate_txt.ps1#L27-L29) in the script\n2. Comment [L26](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-word/blob/master/generate_txt.ps1#L26) in the script\n3. Rerun the script\n4. Undo Step 1 and 2\n\n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.
