Does not allow consecutive blank lines.\n- `blankLineIfLastNot()` - Writes a blank line if what was written last wasn't a blank line.\n- `quote()` - Writes a quote character.\n- `quote(text: string)` - Writes text surrounded in quotes.\n- `indent(times?: number)` - Indents the current line. Optionally indents multiple times when providing a number.\n- `indent(block?: () => void)` - Indents a block of code.\n- `space(times?: number)` - Writes a space. Optionally writes multiple spaces when providing a number.\n- `spaceIfLastNot()` - Writes a space if the last was not a space.\n- `tab(times?: number)` - Writes a tab. Optionally writes multiple tabs when providing a number.\n- `tabIfLastNot()` - Writes a tab if the last was not a tab.\n- `write(text: string)` - Writes some text.\n- `conditionalNewLine(condition: boolean)` - Writes a newline if the condition is matched.\n- `conditionalBlankLine(condition: boolean)` - Writes a blank line if the condition is matched.\n- `conditionalWrite(condition: boolean, text: string)` - Writes if the condition is matched.\n- `conditionalWrite(condition: boolean, textFunc: () => string)` - Writes if the condition is matched.\n- `conditionalWriteLine(condition: boolean, text: string)` - Writes some text and adds a newline if the condition is matched.\n- `conditionalWriteLine(condition: boolean, textFunc: () => string)` - Writes some text and adds a newline if the condition is matched.\n- `setIndentationLevel(indentationLevel: number)` - Sets the current indentation level.\n- `setIndentationLevel(whitespaceText: string)` - Sets the current indentation level based on the provided whitespace text.\n- `withIndentationLevel(indentationLevel: number, action: () => void)` - Sets the indentation level within the provided action.\n- `withIndentationLevel(whitespaceText: string, action: () => void)` - Sets the indentation level based on the provided whitespace text within the action.\n- `getIndentationLevel()` - Gets the current indentation level.\n- `queueIndentationLevel(indentationLevel: number)` - Queues an indentation level to be used once a new line is written.\n- `queueIndentationLevel(whitespaceText: string)` - Queues an indentation level to be used once a new line is written based on the provided whitespace text.\n- `hangingIndent(action: () => void)` - Writes the code within the action with hanging indentation.\n- `hangingIndentUnlessBlock(action: () => void)` - Writes the code within the action with hanging indentation unless a block is written going from the first line to the second.\n- `closeComment()` - Writes text to exit a comment if in a comment.\n- `unsafeInsert(pos: number, text: string)` - Inserts text into the writer. This will not update the writer's state. Read more in its jsdoc.\n- `isInComment()` - Gets if the writer is currently in a comment.\n- `isAtStartOfFirstLineOfBlock()` - Gets if the writer is currently at the start of the first line of the text, block, or indentation block.\n- `isOnFirstLineOfBlock()` - Gets if the writer is currently on the first line of the text, block, or indentation block.\n- `isInString()` - Gets if the writer is currently in a string.\n- `isLastNewLine()` - Gets if the writer last wrote a newline.\n- `isLastBlankLine()` - Gets if the writer last wrote a blank line.\n- `isLastSpace()` - Gets if the writer last wrote a space.\n- `isLastTab()` - Gets if the writer last wrote a tab.\n- `getLastChar()` - Gets the last character written.\n- `endsWith(text: string)` - Gets if the writer ends with the provided text.\n- `iterateLastChars<T>(action: (char: string, index: number) => T | undefined): T | undefined` - Iterates over the writer's characters in reverse order, stopping once a non-null or undefined value is returned and returns that value.\n- `iterateLastCharCodes<T>(action: (charCode: number, index: number) => T | undefined): T | undefined` - A slightly faster version of `iterateLastChars` that doesn't allocate a string per character.\n- `getOptions()` - Gets the writer options.\n- `toString()` - Gets the string.\n\n## Other Features\n\n- Does not indent within strings.\n- Escapes newlines within double and single quotes created with `.quote(text)`.\n\n## C# Version\n\nSee
